Here I attached the solution of 52 Programming Probelm & Solution Book's.

Book Name: 52 Programming Problem & Solution.

Author: Tamim Shahriar Subeen, Tahmid Rafi, Tamanna Nishat Rini.

As the book is written in bangla, so I also write the name of the problem in bangla for your convenience. I solve the problems in C. In future, I will also try to solve the problems in Python and Java.

I solve these problems in Dimik Online Judge. Link: https://dimikoj.com/

There are very slight inconsistency between the book and online judge in problem description. So, be careful when you submit your code in the online judge. Read the problem description again in the online judge. Otherwise you can get wrong answer.

Make sure that you try enough before watch the solution. Please don't copy the whole code, try to understand the logic and then write the code of your own.
